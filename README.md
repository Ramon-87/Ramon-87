  <summary> Ubiquiti Unifi </summary>
     
  ### Network hardware
  
  My network is build on Ubiquiti's Unifi. Unfortunately Ubiquiti isn't always that stable and there are some functions still missing on their controller. But I must admit, I love the all in one solution and UI.
  
  <b>[UDM Pro](https://eu.store.ui.com/products/udm-pro)</b><br />
  <i>The one in all controller for my Unifi Network and Unifi Protect (video surveillance).</i>
  
  <b>[Switch 24 PoE](https://eu.store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-routing-switching/products/usw-24-poe)</b><br />
  <i>A 24-ports switch with PoE where al the RJ45 cables are attached to. Some devices receive Power over Ethernet (PoE) from this switch, so there's no additional cable needed.</i>
  
  <b>[Camera G3 Instant](https://eu.store.ui.com/collections/unifi-protect/products/unifi-protect-g3-instant-camera)</b><br />
  <i>This little camera is my portable camera. I'm not a fan of an indoor camara, but this one I've used as dog-cam :dog:.</i>
  
  <b>[Camera G3 Bullet](https://eu.store.ui.com/collections/unifi-protect/products/unifi-video-camera-g3)</b><br />
  <i>For outside/garden security I'm using this bullet.</i>

  ### Proxmox LXC's
  Since I discoverd [TTeck's Git](https://github.com/tteck/Proxmox), I'm all over in using his scripts. And he is really on fire, recently he added a lot of new containers.

  ### Docker-compose files
  In the past I had a really hate-love story with Docker. So I used always LXC-containers within Proxmox. But some applications I run in Docker. Maybe, someday, I will turn. Check [my docker-compose files](https://github.com/Ramon-87/docker-compose/) to set up you're favourite programms.
